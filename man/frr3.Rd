\title{Fixed Random Rounding to Base 3}
\usage{
frr3(counts, key)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{A numeric vector of counts to apply frr3.}

\item{key}{A key (e.g., a character string) used to generate a consistent seed for randomization.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector with values rounded as per fixed random rounding rules.
}
\description{
This function performs fixed random rounding of a numeric vector to the nearest multiple of 3.
It rounds a number to the nearest number divisible by 3 with 2/3 probability, and to the second nearest multiple with 1/3 probability.
If a number is already divisible by 3, it remains unchanged.
}
\examples{
# Apply to a list

counts <- c(1:12)
key <- "example_key"
rounded_counts <- frr3(counts, key)

# Apply to a dataframe on all numeric columns
require(tidyverse)
df_frr3 <- df \%>\%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ frr3(., "reporting_month")))
}
